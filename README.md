# Recipe Website

## 📌 Project Goals
Recipe App is a web application designed to provide users with a platform to explore, save, and like various recipes. The application follows a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system, ensuring that only administrators can add, modify, and delete recipes, while users can interact with recipes by liking and saving them.

## 🚀 Features
### For Admin:
- 📝 **Create Recipes**
- ✏️ **Update Recipes**
- 🗑 **Delete Recipes**
- 🔍 **Search Recipes**

### For User:
- 📖 **Browse Recipes** – Explore a variety of recipes.
- ❤️ **Like Recipes** – Interact with recipes by adding likes.
- ⭐ **Save to Favorites** – Save preferred recipes to the favorites list.
- 🔍 **Search Recipes** – Easily find recipes based on keywords or ingredients.


## 🏛️ System Architecture Overview
The Recipe App follows a **Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern**:
The system is divided into three key layers:

1️⃣ **Backend – API & Database**
 Node.js, Express.js for the server-side application  
- MongoDB (Mongoose ORM) for data storage  
- JWT Authentication and bcrypt for password protection  
- RESTful API for handling users, recipes, likes, and favorites  
- CORS to prevent unauthorized API access  


2️⃣ **Frontend – User & Admin Interface**
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript  
- Dynamic interaction with API  
- Page-based structure (Home, Dashboard, Recipe Details, Favorites, etc.)  

3️⃣ **Middleware & Security**
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to restrict admin access  
- CORS for API protection  
- Input Validation before saving data
